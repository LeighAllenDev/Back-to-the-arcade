## Site Overview
Back To The Arcade is the website for a fictional Business that would be located in Brighton, England. The aim of the Arcade is to bring back the nostalgic feel of classic 80â€™s arcades when video games were in their infancy.

The Arcade aims to bring Retro games into the modern world and share the joy of these classic machines and games while also allowing for current console games and table top gaming all to be enjoyed in one place.

### Color Scheme

### Typograpy
This website solely uses the Exo 2 font as it fits in with the theme of the logo font and has a retro game feel to it.  
The font was taken from Google Fonts as described in the credits section.

## Current Features Common to all pages
Across the site I have used the same styles for each of the web pages so they are easy to follow and the code is readable.

### Header Element:
 * The Header encorporates a logo image that takes up the same amount of the screen across devices.
 * There is a Navigation bar with working links across all devices, it has different sizes and styles depending on the size of the device:
      * On Mobile devices such as smart phones, the nav bar shows as a burger menu icon with a dropdown toggle.
